# DAY 11 after the Farewell

Actually I would post it earlier but I got ill.

I think it's the first time when I finally feel that I control my life. It makes me stressless and calm, and also takes my insecurity away.

I think the main reason of my problems is the fact that I waste my energy and don't get it back. Everything in this world should be mutual to keep balance.

I realised that people usually give things which they have lack of and would like to get back. So I give love to everyone because I feel lack of love, because I don't feel that I deserve to be loved and always try my best to prove that I do. I proved it to others but could never prove it to myself... That's why when some people loved me regardless, I never believed them and my relationships never lasted more than an year. When I was starting relationship with someone, I knew beforehand that I would end them soon because I was afraid of being bound to someone who (as I used to think then) would hurt me in the future. I feel such a shame to realise that I broke hearts of innocent people and gave them hope because of my egocentrism, and I'm afraid that I used them to feel loved but never truly loved them. Although I really tried to make them happy and was sincere about my feelings towards them. They knew I didn't feel love but were hoping I would. Actually love is about deeds and not about feelings, and it's much harder to do good deeds to someone you feel indifference than to someone you feel love. So maybe it was them who didn't love me?

Anyway, since I decided to love myself to be able to love others not because I feel lack of it but because I want it, here is my list.

# What makes me feel loved ?

1. Hugs.
2. Spending time with me.
3. Words about love.
4. Gifts and surprises.
5. Being priority.
6. Listening to me without any judge.
7. Freedom in choices.
8. Letting me cry when I feel so.
9. Cooking for me.
10. Making compliments.
11. Massage (What? No, not erotic one but real massage)
12. Caring about me when I'm ill, buying medicines for this.

I wrote it for myself to do all from this list for myself to feel loved without anyone beside. I already do some of them.
I think it's more than enough for now, maybe I will add new things in the future.
